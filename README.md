# hello-world
I have made some changes in the master which are different than when new_branch was created and I'm going to commit and push these changes to remote repository.
This edit is from 'repo second cloning' directory to collaborate in the 'hello-world' from two accounts.  
To check the conflict in pull with if the file is not added or added.
